# bulkan
My small one-shot renderer. Takes an obj file with texture and normal maps, returns a .ppm file of the generated image. I owe huge thanks to the wiki of the TinyRenderer (https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki) for providing me with theory behind rasterization.

Features
* .obj parser
* tangent space normal map support
* custom pixel/fragment shader support
* look_at function to observe the model from different angles
* etc.
